This was the final project for ICS 212, a class about program structures. All of our assignments were done in either C or C++ on a UH hosted unix server via the terminal. This is also where we get to choose our camps of either Vim or Emacs. I personally liked vim more, but it might just be because we learned it first. Before we could implement SHA-1 we had to learn what SHA-1 is. It is a hashing algorithm. Hashing algorithms deterministically convert any length input into a fixed length output. An ideal hashing algorithm will always return a unique hashed output from an input. This was the case for SHA-1 until recently in 2017 when it was broken be causing a collisions (the same output from two seperate inputs).

This project was my final project for ICS 211 (Intro to Programming II) and it was also my first time working with a team to develop a piece of software. The purpose of this project was to apply everything that we learned up to that point in one comprehensive project. This includes things like binary search trees to search for your caught Pokemon, object heiarchy be creating a sub Pokemon from a base template Pokemon class and, in my opinion, the most important part was using Github to collaborate with our team mates. All of this was painfully packaged through GUI made with JFrames.

Our group for this project orignally contained three members, including me. Unfortuantley, one of our memebers had a good enough grade that if he did not need to do this final project to pass the class, so our group was down to two. Because of this me and my partner had to put in extra work, but thats just how it goes sometimes. I did a majority of the UI and base implementation of the binary search tree that allowed for searching and deleting of Pokemon from the Pokedex.

For my first collabrative project, the main thing I learned is that things happen and sometimes people have different agendas which may cause a hiccup in the gameplan. While, everyone would prefer for the plan to work, I think it is important to accept that unforseen circumstances do happen and you have to be able to adapt and do what needs to be done. I guess in hindsight, loosing a third of my group might have been a good thing.
