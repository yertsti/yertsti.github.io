This project utulizes canvas in HTML to create and display cool 2D graphics using JavaScript. This script draws colored circles that orbit around your mouse in the window. The functionality of this is non-existant, but it does look pretty cool. Because this was my first time creating anything more than a simple algorithm that prints to console, pretty much everything was derived from a tutorial from Youtube.

A majority of this project was creating the code to run the animation in JavaScript and a very small portion of it was creating the canvas in html to display the animation on the web page. 

At the time when I completed this project, I thought it was the coolest thing in the world and that I know how to program. I could tell you what each part did and how to change the variables to get the behavior you want. But, under the hood I had no idea what was going on. It was like being able to drive a car without knowing what was going on in the engine. For driving, this is fine, but for software development it becomes a bit of an issue. Because knowing how things work is a part of the job description of a software developer.

With hindsight, if I were to re-create this project without the aid of a tutorial, I would have no chance of actually completeing it. I think this experience lead to the realization that just because I was able to do something, it does not necessarily mean that I actually understand how to do it. This stands as a good cautinary tale that software engineering is more than just following a tutorial.



Implementing SHA-1 was quite the step up compared to all of our previous assignments. The hardest part was reading the data from the file and converting it into discrete 512 bit chunks that are then each consecutively shoved through the hashing function that eventually creates the hashed value. The hashing funciton was quite interesting to work with beacuse it uses a bunch of bitwise black magic operators that takes in any sized input and mushes it down into a nicely packaged 160 bit output.

This was my first time creating a piece of software with no boiler plate or example code, so I had to learn the ways of google. Eventually, I came to the realization that every question I asked had already been asked somewhere on the internet. It was just a matter of if I could find it. This is probably the most important experience I gained from this project because being able to ask the right questions can do wonders in any field, but especially in programming because it is so well documented and collbartive.
