This is my first time programming

Implementing SHA-1 was quite the step up compared to all of our previous assignments. The hardest part was reading the data from the file and converting it into discrete 512 bit chunks that are then each consecutively shoved through the hashing function that eventually creates the hashed value. The hashing funciton was quite interesting to work with beacuse it uses a bunch of bitwise black magic operators that takes in any sized input and mushes it down into a nicely packaged 160 bit output.

This was my first time creating a piece of software with no boiler plate or example code, so I had to learn the ways of google. Eventually, I came to the realization that every question I asked had already been asked somewhere on the internet. It was just a matter of if I could find it. This is probably the most important experience I gained from this project because being able to ask the right questions can do wonders in any field, but especially in programming because it is so well documented and collbartive.
