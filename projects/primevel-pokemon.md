This project was my final project for ICS 211 (Intro to Programming II) and it was also my first time working with a team to develop a piece of software. The purpose of this project was to apply everything that we learned up to that point in one comprehensive project. This includes things like binary search trees to search for your caught Pokemon, object heiarchy be creating a sub Pokemon from a base template Pokemon class and, in my opinion, the most important part was using Github to collaborate with our team mates. All of this was painfully packaged through GUI made with JFrames.

Our group for this project orignally contained three members, including me. Unfortuantley, one of our memebers had a good enough grade that if he did not need to do this final project to pass the class, so our group was down to two. Because of this me and my partner had to put in extra work, but thats just how it goes sometimes. I did a majority of the UI and base implementation of the binary search tree that allowed for searching and deleting of Pokemon from the Pokedex.

For my first collabrative project, the main thing I learned is that things happen and sometimes people have different agendas which may cause a hiccup in the gameplan. While, everyone would prefer for the plan to work, I think it is important to accept that unforseen circumstances do happen and you have to be able to adapt and do what needs to be done. I guess in hindsight, loosing a third of my group might have been a good thing. Another important takeaway is the advantage of object oriented programming. The overhead of creating the base classes of Pokemon and all the different sub-classes seemed like it was not worth the effort, but if we were to scale up the project to tens or hundreds of Pokemon the amount of time saved by utilizing inheritence would have been totally worth it.
