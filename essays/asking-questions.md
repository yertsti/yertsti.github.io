## Asking Questions
When it comes to learning new things, asking questions is a proven way to learn new things. So, "Asking all questions is a good thing?" you might ask. Unfortunatley, not all questions are created equally. This is especially true when asking questions online via things like StackOverflow an online techincal forum for programming. On this forum, you will see a wide variety of questions. Some questions are good and generate a desired answer by providing clear background information and context, shows that the question asker has done some research on it, but needs a little bit more clarification and the asker put time and effort to clearly and poitely ask their question. This makes sense because the questions asker is essientially asking for a favor from the forum boards, so the asker should try their best to make the question easy and worthwhile to answer. A bad question on the other hand is often inconsiderate by providing very little information or just asking a questiont that has been asked a million times over on the forums. Considering the amount of bad questions that exist on StackOverflow, it is unfortunatly evident that not evyerone knows how to ask a good questions.

## Smart Question

## Not So Smart Question
A classic architeype for a bad question is just copy pasting your homework problem and asking for a solution. An example of this type of question can be found <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35245296/calculating-an-average-with-an-array-in-java-homework">here</a>. This person is has several basic computational problems in Java and is asking for a solution to find the average of a set of numbers. The asker just bluntly says they don't know how to find the average and does not show that they atleast attempted the problem by showing their solution that does not work. It also does not help that the answer to this question could be found with a quick Google search. I understand that this question was asked by someone who is just getting into programming and that it is understandable to have questions that may seem simple to someone more practiced, but that does not change the fact that the information was already out there and they couldn't be bothered to look for it. Because they asked such a low effort question, they get a low effort response as a reuslt. The response being the two steps of finding the average in plain English. The question asker still does not know how to find the average of a set of numbers in Java and wasted the time of the answerer. All of this combined makes this question a bad question.

When you think of hobbies, programming probably isn't at the top of the list. In fact, programming is most likely viewed as a job. The point I am trying to argue is that programming is a very fun and rewarding hobby. Programming, on the surface, seems like a cold and technical skill that is not very fun or expressive, but going past the superficial layer the creative and expressive nature of programming becomes clear. 

## Getting Started
A barrier to entry often dissuades us from pursuing a new hobby. Fortunately, the barrier to entry for programming is abysmally low. In fact, if you are reading this, you most likely have the tools you need to get started. Those being a computer and access to the internet. Maybe the financial barrier is low, but is it hard to get access to information to learn how to program? No, the best part of programming is the incredible amount of thorough and concise information that is available, most times for free, on the internet and the collaborative nature of the field allows for easy access to new information and answers to questions. Once  you get the hang of it, there is nothing more rewarding than creating a solution to a problem.

## More Than Just Fun
Because computers are an integral part to pretty much every aspect of our lives, being able to program allows you to tackle a wide variety of problems. Ultimately, programming a computer to do something is an exercise of problem solving skills. Being able to think critically and solve problems is a universally useful skill to have. If you get good enough at programming, this hobby can be easily leveraged into a well paying job. While having a college degree in Computer Science or Computer Engineering definitely helps, if you have an impressive enough portfolio, getting a job without a degree is definitely a possbility.
