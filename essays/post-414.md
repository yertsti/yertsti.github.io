### 414 Overview
ICS 414: Software Engineering II is a continuation of ICS 314: Software Engineering I. In ICS 314 you spend a majority of the semester learning about the basics of the tech stack consisting of Meteor, MongoDB and React. In the last month or so you cobble together a small group project consisting of what you learned. 

ICS 414 leverages everything you learned in ICS 314 by consisting of a semester long group project to deliver a product to a customer. This environment sets you up to experience a more realistic representation of the software development process.  

### The Destination
The request from the customer was to make it easier to manage the rooms under the ICS department in POST. We implemented the request as s CRUD website to interface with the database to allow for easier management of resources. 

### The Experience
Teams for this project were randomly assigned at the beginning of the semester, so learning how to work with your new teammates was the first hurdle to overcome. Once we got to know each other we started planning the project. The planning process went well, but in hindsight it would have been nice if we spoke more directly with the customer to get clarification on their request because we spent a decent amount of time working on a feature that wasn't very important in the eyes of the customer. After going through all the joys of software development, we ended up with a product that did what was requested, but it definitionally could have been better.

### Lessons learned
This class was a great opportunity to get a taste of a more realistic software development process. I had the opportunity to implement a bunch of cool things like an interactive SVG map or importing and exporting data as a CSV file.
